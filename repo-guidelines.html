## General Guidelines

* When in doubt, test it.  If you can't test it, re-think what you are doing.
* Code formatting and internal application architecture should be consistent.</pre>

# Code of Conduct

We are committed to keeping our community open and inclusive.

**Our Code of Conduct can be found here**:
http://opensource.stitchfix.com/code-of-conduct.html</pre>

            Configuration for continuous integration in <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Configure <code>.travis.yml</code> such that it triggers builds on all platforms in use by Stitch Fix, all <em>reasonable</em> platforms in use by the community and whatever the bleeding edge is.  For example, Ruby libraries should be built on Ruby 1.9.3 and above as well as <code>ruby-head</code>.
          </p>
        </li>

          <p class="thick">
            When releasing versions, make use of the GitHub Releases feature:
          </p>
          <ol class="ml2">
            <li>Create a tag named <code>v1.2.3</code> following <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>.</li>
            <li>This will create a release in GitHub.  Edit that release</li>
            <li>Itemize out <em>all</em> changes since the last release.  These should <em>all</em> reference pull requests</li>
            <li>If someone outside Stitch Fix contributed to the PR, thank them explicitly using GitHub <code>@-</code>mentions.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            A good example is <a href="https://github.com/stitchfix/immutable-struct/releases">immutable-struct</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="thick">
            Prefer the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> license, and include it in <code>LICENSE.txt</code>
          </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="thick">Gems should be laid out in a standard fashion.</p>
          <ul class="list-condensed">
            <li>The gem name should use underscores as word separators.</li>
            <li>All code goes in <code>lib/gem_name</code>, for example <code>lib/merch_calendar</code></li>
            <li><p>
                The mail file in <code>lib/gem_name.rb</code> should establish a namespace module and <code>require</code> all the other files. It should be sufficient to require just this file in order to use the gem.</p>
          <pre class="bordered border-xs border-gray p1 bg-white round-md">
module MerchCalendar
end

require 'merch_calendar/version'
require 'merch_calendar/util'
# ...</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There should be a file named <code>lib/gem_name/version.rb</code> that contains the gem's version inside its namespace in the public constant <code>VERSION</code>
              </p>
              <pre class="bordered border-xs border-gray p1 bg-white round-md">
module MerchCalendar
  VERSION = "1.1.3"
end</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not assume Rails.  Explicitly <code>require</code> dependencies in each file, and require <strong>only</strong> what you need.
            </li>
            <li>
              Put all dependencies in the Gemspec.  Your <code>Gemfile</code> should generally be pretty empty.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prefer RSpec and put all tests in <code>spec/</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Your <code>Rakefile</code> should be able to run tests and release the gem.  This is a good start:
              </p>
<pre class="bordered border-xs border-gray p1 bg-white round-md">
require 'rubygems/package_task'

            <li>Start with what <code>bundle gem</code> gives you for a Gemspec.</li>
            <li><code>spec.authors</code> should have “Stitch Fix Engineering” as the first author.</li>
            <li>For each Stitch Fix employee that has contributed, list them in <code>spec.authors</code> after “Stitch Fix Engineering”.</li>
            <li>For <em>significant</em> contributes from non-Stitch Fix employees, list them as well (ask permission first).</li>
            <li><code>spec.email</code> should contain <code>eng@stitchfix.com</code>, followed by the <em>primary GitHub emails</em> of the contributors in <code>spec.authors</code>.</li>
            <li><code>spec.description</code> and <code>spec.summary</code> should be identical and match the description in the GitHub repo.</li>
            <li><code>spec.license</code> should match the license.</li>
            <li><code>spec.homepage</code> should be the GitHub page.</li>
            <li>Add runtime dependencies judiciously.  When you <em>must</em> keep the version as loose as possible.</li>
            <li>Keep development dependencies' version requirements as loose as possible.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
          <li>
            <p class="thick">Write and publish documentation.</p>
            <p>
              Use RDoc for all public members and configure the gem on <a href="http://rdoc.info">RDoc.info</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="thick">Release as the shared user</p>
            <p>
              Do not release gems as yourself.  Release them as the Stitch Fix RubyGems owner.  See our internal document “Pushing Release of Open Source Gems” for the specifics.
